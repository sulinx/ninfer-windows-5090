# HTTP serving

`build/apps/ninfer-serve` loads one registered artifact and exposes OpenAI- and
Anthropic-compatible HTTP endpoints over one resident NInfer Engine.

## Start the server

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080 \
  --max-context 240000 \
  --kv-capacity 240000 \
  --max-concurrency 2 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --device-state-slots 2 \
  --host-state-slots 8 \
  --host-kv-mib 8192 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft \
  --preserve-thinking
```

The command uses Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4. Each request has a 240,000-token logical ceiling. A shared
240,000-token Main Text KV pool serves admitted requests; either request may use the full capacity
when running alone, and two requests run concurrently when their complete reservations fit.

With `C=2` and two extra Device checkpoint slots, the process owns two active StateImage guarantees
plus a global pool of two Device-resident checkpoints. Eight pinned Host State slots and 8 GiB of
pinned Host KV retain inactive continuations under Device pressure. Active request capacity is two.

Other artifacts use the same command shape with their own path. For 35B-A3B text-only DFlash,
replace the MTP selection with `--spec dflash --draft-tokens 7 --lm-head-draft`; DFlash cannot be
combined with `--vision`.

When `--model-id` is omitted, the server advertises and accepts the loaded container's exact
`identity.model_id`. An explicit `--model-id` remains a public HTTP alias override and does not
select or alter the artifact.

Vision is disabled by default: its weights and Vision-specific unified-workspace extent are not
allocated, and media requests and token-count requests fail with HTTP 400 `vision_disabled`. Add
`--vision` when the server must accept image or video input. Speculative residency is likewise
frozen by `--spec mtp|dflash` and `--draft-tokens`; omitting `--spec` loads neither backend.
`--lm-head-draft` additionally loads the optimized proposal head. DFlash is 35B-A3B text-only and
cannot be combined with `--vision`. A later request cannot enable a capability omitted at startup.

## Endpoints

## OpenAI Chat Completions

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "Answer concisely."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is speculative decoding?"}
    ],
    "max_tokens": 128
  }'
```

The endpoint supports:

- `system`, `developer`, `user`, `assistant`, and `tool` history;
- string content and ordered text, `image_url`, and `video_url` parts;
- `max_completion_tokens` and the legacy `max_tokens` spelling;
- `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, presence/frequency penalties, and a nonnegative `seed`;
- one stop string or an array of stop strings;
- non-streaming responses and server-sent event streams;
- `stream_options.include_usage`;
- function tools, tool choices, assistant tool-call history, and tool-result messages;
- the top-level `reasoning_effort` field;
- the `enable_thinking` extension;
- `chat_template_kwargs.preserve_thinking` and the top-level `preserve_thinking` alias.

The request `model` must equal the public model ID: the artifact `identity.model_id` by default, or
the explicit `--model-id` override. Reasoning is returned separately as `reasoning_content`; answer
text remains in `content`.

Message roles retain their input order through schema translation. The Qwen family frontend maps
both `system` and `developer` to system-class ChatML blocks at their original positions; it does not
move later instructions to the beginning of the conversation. A leading instruction keeps the
artifact template's existing tool/reasoning-instruction composition.

At startup, NInfer resolves prompt capabilities from the exact `frontend/chat_template.jinja`
resource embedded in the loaded artifact. It does not infer them from the request's `model` field,
the artifact identity, or a target profile. A recognized effort-capable template exposes `low`,
`medium`, and `xhigh`; omitting effort uses that template's declared default. An explicit effort
not exposed by the loaded template returns HTTP 400 with code
`reasoning_effort_not_supported` before prompt preparation.

`--default-thinking-budget N` sets a positive process default for requests whose final resolved
prompt semantics enable thinking. It does not add or reinterpret an HTTP request field: the
existing `reasoning_effort` and `enable_thinking` inputs still decide whether thinking is enabled,
and a request resolved to non-thinking receives no cap. `--no-thinking` may coexist with this
option because a protocol request can explicitly enable thinking. In this phase, Anthropic's
existing `thinking.budget_tokens` member does not override the process default.

Add `--default-thinking-budget 512` to the startup command to cap model-origin thinking at 512
tokens for every thinking-enabled request.

At the cap boundary, Engine first honors a natural `</think>`, stop condition, cancellation, or
total output/context limit. If thinking remains open, it commits Qwen's canonical early-close
guidance and close marker to the same model sequence without sampling, streams the guidance as a
reasoning delta, and continues normal content or tool-call generation. Inserted tokens count in
completion usage and the request's `max_tokens`/`max_output_tokens` budget. If the effective output
capacity extends past the cap but cannot fit the complete tokenizer-derived control suffix plus one
post-close model token, preparation is rejected with HTTP 400 code
`thinking_budget_capacity_insufficient` rather than partially inserting control. The server does
not promise that the model will emit nonempty content or a tool call after the marker.

For Chat Completions, `reasoning_effort: "none"` disables thinking. `low`, `medium`, and `xhigh`
select the corresponding template effort when available. The other OpenAI protocol values
`minimal`, `high`, and `max` are parsed but rejected when the loaded template does not expose them.
`enable_thinking` controls the same new-turn thinking switch; a contradictory combination with
`reasoning_effort` returns `conflicting_template_option`.

`preserve_thinking` controls whether reasoning from closed assistant turns remains in later
prompts. It defaults to the server setting, which is off unless `--preserve-thinking` is used. If
both OpenAI spellings are present they must carry the same boolean value. Unknown non-null
`chat_template_kwargs` are rejected.

Streaming begins with an assistant-role chunk, sends separate reasoning and content deltas, then a
finish-reason chunk and `[DONE]`. When `stream_options.include_usage` is true, a final empty
`choices` chunk contains completed usage.

### Multimodal request

Start the server with `--vision` before sending media:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
    "messages": [{
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/image.png"}},
        {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."}
      ]
    }],
    "max_tokens": 128
  }'
```

OpenAI image and video sources may be HTTP(S) URLs or base64 data URLs.

Text and media requests use one complete-prompt context contract. After chat-template rendering and
media-token expansion, the result must fit Engine `--max-context`. The current Vision runtime also
has a 32,768 merged-token envelope (131,072 raw patches); the effective Vision limit is therefore
`min(--max-context, 32768)`. There is no fixed image/video item-count limit: item count is admitted
through aggregate source-byte, decoded-pixel, raw-patch, Vision-token, and live-memory budgets.

Media cache misses run as independent decode → resize → BF16-pack tasks on a bounded host worker
pool. Prepared payloads are keyed by SHA-256 of the acquired bytes plus modality, so repeated media
in later requests reuses the exact immutable BF16 patch input; concurrent identical misses use one
single-flight build. `--media-cache-mib` bounds LRU-retained payloads, while
`--media-live-mib` bounds every cache-, request-, or runtime-referenced payload. Cache eviction does
not invalidate a request reference, and live bytes are returned only when the final reference is
released. A request-level preparation gate derived from the live limit prevents concurrent partial
builds from deadlocking the memory account.

An expanded prompt beyond `--max-context` returns HTTP 400 `context_length_exceeded`, including
the prepared token count and configured context ceiling. A media preprocessing resource rejection
returns HTTP 400 `media_budget_exceeded`. HTTP 413 `request_too_large` is reserved for a raw request
body that exceeds `--max-request-mib` before JSON parsing; it is not used for model-context or media
resource errors.

## OpenAI Responses Core

NInfer implements the typed-Item and semantic-event core of the OpenAI
[Responses API](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/responses/overview). All
registered artifact identities use this same adapter and Engine route. It is intentionally not
advertised as full parity with OpenAI-hosted tools, durable cloud storage, background jobs,
Conversations, or compaction.

### Create a Response

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/responses \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
    "instructions": "Answer concisely.",
    "input": "What is speculative decoding?",
    "max_output_tokens": 128,
    "store": true
  }'
```

The same endpoint works with OpenAI SDKs by replacing their base URL:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", api_key="local-secret")
response = client.responses.create(
    model="qwen3.8-27b",
    instructions="Answer concisely.",
    input="What is speculative decoding?",
    max_output_tokens=128,
)
print(response.output_text)  # SDK helper derived from response.output
```

`output_text` is an SDK convenience property. It is not emitted as a top-level wire field; the
wire response contains typed `output` Items.

### Create request fields

| Field | NInfer Responses Core contract |
|---|---|
| `model` | required non-empty string; must equal the artifact-derived public model ID or explicit `--model-id` override |
| `input` | required string or non-empty typed Item array |
| `instructions` | optional string, inserted before the reconstructed conversation for this request only |
| `previous_response_id` | optional ID of a retained local Response |
| `max_output_tokens` | integer at least `16`; default is `--default-max-tokens` |
| `stream` | boolean; `true` selects Responses SSE rather than a JSON body |
| `store` | boolean, default `true`; controls local retrieval and continuation state |
| `temperature` | finite number in `[0,2]` |
| `top_p` | finite number in `[0,1]` |
| `metadata` | at most 16 string pairs; keys at most 64 characters and values at most 512 |
| `reasoning.effort` | `none` disables thinking; `low`, `medium`, or `xhigh` selects an effort exposed by the loaded chat template; `minimal`, `high`, and `max` return `reasoning_effort_not_supported` for the registered templates |
| `chat_template_kwargs.preserve_thinking` | optional boolean controlling whether closed-turn reasoning remains in reconstructed prompts |
| `preserve_thinking` | top-level alias for the same option; conflicting values are rejected |
| `text.format` | omitted or `{"type":"text"}` only |
| `tools` | flat Responses function definitions; see below |
| `tool_choice` | `auto` or `none` |
| `parallel_tool_calls` | omitted or `true` |
| `truncation` | omitted or `disabled`; overlong input fails instead of silently dropping Items |
| `top_logprobs` | omitted or `0` |
| `service_tier` | omitted, `auto`, or `default`; the response reports `default` |
| `background` | omitted or `false` |
| `include` | omitted or an empty array |
| `stream_options` | omitted or `{"include_obfuscation":false}` |

Unknown top-level fields fail with `unknown_parameter`. Recognized but unsupported features fail
with a field-specific 400 error instead of being silently ignored.

### Input Item contract

String `input` is normalized to one user `message` with an `input_text` part. Array input accepts:

| Item | Supported form |
|---|---|
| `message` | roles `user`, `assistant`, `system`, and `developer`; string content or typed content array |
| `input_text` | message content part containing string `text` |
| `output_text` | assistant-message replay part containing string `text` |
| `input_image` | user-message part with HTTP(S) or data-URI `image_url`; detail omitted or `auto`; requires server `--vision` |
| `input_video` | NInfer extension with HTTP(S) or data-URI `video_url`; requires server `--vision` |
| `reasoning` | raw replay Item with an empty `summary` and `reasoning_text` content parts |
| `function_call` | completed assistant call with optional `id`, and required `call_id`, `name`, and JSON-object string `arguments` |
| `function_call_output` | completed tool result with required `call_id` and string `output` |

Adjacent function-call Items are grouped into one assistant history turn. A reasoning Item attaches
to the following assistant message or function call. Input Item IDs are preserved when supplied and
generated otherwise; duplicate IDs fail.

System and developer message Items retain their positions in the input array. Top-level
`instructions` is represented as a leading developer turn for the current request; target-specific
role lowering occurs only in the Qwen family frontend.

`input_file`, `input_audio`, image `file_id`, non-`auto` image detail, reasoning summaries or
encrypted reasoning, message `phase`, and other Item/content types are not supported. HTTP media
URLs stored in a response chain are fetched again when that chain is continued; use data URIs when
the historical media bytes must be immutable.

### Function tools

Responses function definitions are flat rather than Chat Completions' nested `function` object:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Get current weather",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},
    "required": ["city"]
  },
  "strict": false
}
```

NInfer renders these definitions in the Qwen prompt and parses model output into separate
`function_call` output Items. Each output has a protocol Item `id` (`fc_...`) and a distinct
`call_id` (`call_...`). The client executes the function and sends a `function_call_output` Item in
a later request. NInfer does not execute functions or enforce JSON Schema through constrained
decoding, so `strict:true`, `tool_choice:required`, named tool choice, hosted tools, MCP tools, and
custom free-form tools are rejected.

### Response object and usage

A terminal wire response has `object: "response"`, one of `completed`, `incomplete`, or
`cancelled` in `status`, and a typed `output` array. NInfer may emit:

- a `reasoning` Item containing raw `reasoning_text` and an empty summary;
- an assistant `message` containing an `output_text` part;
- one or more `function_call` Items.

Ordinary model/string stops produce `completed`. Output-token or context-capacity exhaustion
produces `incomplete` with `incomplete_details.reason: "max_output_tokens"`. Errors accepted after
an SSE response has started produce `response.failed`; validation and preparation errors remain
normal HTTP error responses.

Usage is checkpoint-native:

```json
{
  "input_tokens": 42,
  "input_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 17},
  "output_tokens": 12,
  "output_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 5},
  "total_tokens": 54
}
```

`input_tokens` includes the chat template and expanded media tokens. `cached_tokens` is the exact
checkpoint-proven prompt prefix reused by Engine. `output_tokens` is the count of accepted generated token
IDs, including a withheld stop token when applicable. `reasoning_tokens` is counted in the Qwen
output decoder while accepted tokens are still in the reasoning channel; it is not estimated by
re-tokenizing decoded text.

### Responses streaming

Set `stream:true` for semantic Server-Sent Events. Every frame uses both the SSE event name and a
matching JSON `type`, and every JSON event has a monotonically increasing `sequence_number`:

```text
event: response.output_text.delta
data: {"type":"response.output_text.delta","sequence_number":7,...}

```

The normal lifecycle is:

1. `response.created`, then `response.in_progress`;
2. `response.output_item.added` and `response.content_part.added`;
3. zero or more `response.reasoning_text.delta` or `response.output_text.delta` events;
4. matching `*.done`, `response.content_part.done`, and `response.output_item.done` events;
5. exactly one `response.completed`, `response.incomplete`, or `response.failed` terminal event.

Function arguments use `response.function_call_arguments.delta` and `.done`. IDs, output indices,
and content indices remain stable, and concatenated deltas equal the terminal Item. Responses SSE
does not emit the Chat Completions `[DONE]` sentinel. With tools enabled, ordinary answer text still
streams immediately; only an ambiguous `<tool_call>` suffix or the structured tool region is held.
Malformed tool markup is flushed back as ordinary text without losing bytes.

### Local response state and resources

`store` defaults to `true`. Stored Responses live only in this server process and are bounded by an
LRU store. They are lost on restart and are not OpenAI's durable cloud retention service.

`previous_response_id` reconstructs the complete stored input/output Item history before the new
input. The current `instructions` value is placed first but is not saved into the continuation
context, matching the Responses rule that previous top-level instructions do not carry forward.
Function definitions are request configuration rather than conversation Items and must be sent
again on tool-result turns. The reconstructed prompt follows the ordinary Engine path, so compatible
checkpoint reuse applies naturally.

A stored Response also retains its resolved `preserve_thinking` value. A child which omits the
field inherits the parent value. An explicit different value creates a new semantic branch; prompt
rendering and identity still determine reuse. Changing the boolean alone never invalidates an exact
checkpoint already proved compatible by the model runtime.

For Engine-local reuse, a stored root Response receives one bounded session key derived from its
response ID, and every `previous_response_id` child inherits that key. `store:false` roots remain
anonymous; a `store:false` child may read its inherited session checkpoint but does not replace the
stored chain's latest endpoint. Response-store eviction or deletion removes the HTTP object, not an
independently retained Engine checkpoint; the latter remains bounded by the Engine's own retention
and pressure policy. No session key or cache marker is added to the HTTP schema.

Resource behavior:

| Endpoint | Contract |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/responses/{id}` | returns the stored terminal object, or 404 `response_not_found` |
| `DELETE /v1/responses/{id}` | removes public retrieval and returns `response.deleted`; descendant contexts already retained by other Responses remain usable |
| `GET /v1/responses/{id}/input_items` | returns normalized Items supplied to that request; supports `after`, `limit` `1..100` (default `20`), and `order` `asc|desc` (default `desc`) |
| `POST /v1/responses/{id}/cancel` | explicitly fails because background execution is unsupported |
| `POST /v1/responses/compact` | explicitly fails with `compaction_not_supported` |

`store:false` Responses cannot be retrieved or used as `previous_response_id`. LRU eviction and
explicit deletion also make an ID unavailable. A single Response larger than the configured store
capacity fails with `response_store_capacity_exceeded` rather than silently pretending it was
stored.

### Responses input token count

`POST /v1/responses/input_tokens` accepts exactly `model` and `input`, performs the same typed Item,
template, and media expansion, and does not run generation:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/responses/input_tokens \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3.8-27b","input":"Count this prompt."}'
```

```json
{"object":"response.input_tokens","input_tokens":11}
```

Unsupported Create fields include Conversations, prompt templates, context management, hosted
moderation, prompt-cache controls, safety/user identifiers, Structured Outputs/JSON mode,
non-empty `include`, background execution, compaction, files/audio, and OpenAI-hosted/MCP/custom
tools. These are compatibility boundaries, not silently accepted placeholders.

## Anthropic Messages

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/messages \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
    "max_tokens": 128,
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Explain prefix reuse in one sentence."}
    ]
  }'
```

The endpoint supports top-level system text, ordered mid-conversation system messages,
user/assistant history, text and image blocks, thinking blocks, tool-use history, tool results,
client-defined tools, non-streaming responses, and Anthropic SSE events.
Mid-conversation system messages remain at their `messages` array position and are not merged into
the top-level system instruction. A system section must follow a user/tool-result message and be
final or immediately precede an assistant message; it cannot interrupt a tool-use/tool-result pair.
Consecutive system messages remain separate ordered turns.

Anthropic ephemeral `cache_control` on top-level system text blocks and client tool definitions
marks a shared stable-prefix boundary. Because the Qwen prompt renders tools before the leading
system instruction, NInfer retains the last marked tool boundary unless a later marked system
boundary exists; when several system blocks are marked, it retains the last one. The boundary is a
retention hint rather than a forced hit: reuse still requires exact rendered-token compatibility.
Ephemeral `cache_control` on the final content block of a user or assistant message marks the
normalized message boundary as a private long anchor; a non-final message-block breakpoint is
rejected because it cannot be represented as an exact Qwen message frontier.

`thinking.type: "disabled"` disables thinking; other supported values enable it.
The independent top-level `preserve_thinking` boolean controls closed-turn history and otherwise
uses the server default.

Anthropic `output_config.effort` accepts the protocol values `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and
`max`. The value is then checked against the loaded chat template in the same way as the OpenAI
endpoints; the registered effort-capable template exposes `low`, `medium`, and `xhigh`. Combining
an effort with `thinking.type: "disabled"` is rejected as contradictory.

Anthropic's `model` field is treated as a response label and does not select the loaded artifact.

`POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` uses the artifact's tokenizer, chat template, and media expansion
without running GPU generation:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/messages/count_tokens \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Count this prompt."}]
  }'
```

## Authentication and CORS

Pass `--api-key VALUE` to require the same value as an OpenAI bearer token or Anthropic
`x-api-key` header. `GET /health` and CORS preflight requests remain unauthenticated.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/models \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer local-secret'
```

`--cors` adds permissive browser CORS headers. It is disabled by default.

## Server options

Context-cost coefficients resolve once at startup from generic defaults, matching compiled values,
and optional transfer or artifact-prefill entries from `--context-cost-presets FILE`. A malformed
file aborts startup; the startup console line and JSONL record identify the selected source.

Engine selects sampling defaults from the loaded model and the request's resolved thinking mode.
Qwen3.6-27B and Qwen3.8-27B use `1.0/0.95/20/0/0` for
temperature/top-p/top-k/min-p/presence penalty in thinking mode and `0.7/0.80/20/0/1.5` in
non-thinking mode. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B differs only in its thinking presence penalty, which is `1.5`.
Frequency penalty is `0` for all registered presets. Process flags override registered values,
request fields override process flags, and `--greedy` finally forces temperature `0`.

For `C=--max-concurrency` and `H=--device-state-slots`, total Device StateImage capacity is `C+H`:
`C` slots guarantee active requests and `H` is a global checkpoint pool. Host State and Host KV are
independent startup-fixed pinned-memory capacities; Host KV is shared by Main and the selected
Backend pool and is consumed in physical page extents. `--no-prefix-reuse` selects root-only Engine
mode and cannot be combined with any of the seven explicit context-cache capacity flags, including
zero-valued flags.

Run `./build/apps/ninfer-serve --help` for the exact option contract.

## Structured request log

`--request-log-jsonl FILE` enables the machine-readable measurement log. The server opens `FILE`
in append mode and flushes every event, so successive model or MTP blocks may share one campaign
file. The parent directory must already exist. Failure to open the file aborts startup; the log path
is also rejected if it resolves to the model artifact.

Add `--request-log-jsonl profiles/bench/run/server.requests.jsonl` to the startup command to write
the log at that path.

Every line is one `ninfer_serve_request_log` schema-v17 JSON object. All events carry
`timestamp_unix_ms` and a process-unique `server_instance_id`; request IDs are monotonic only within
that server instance. Successful request-start records include request-scoped acquisition,
media-preprocessing wall/work, tokenizer, cache hit/miss/single-flight, and payload-size fields;
they do not infer request behavior from process-global counter deltas.

`request_done.materialization` is the immutable decision committed for that request. It reports predicted immediate,
future-loss and total nanoseconds; evaluated targets and projection work; planning/search nanoseconds; stop reason;
model-optimal and budget-exhausted flags; the best remaining lower bound and absolute/relative gap; selected degradation
units; and whether the selected target was the maximal root fallback. Stop reasons are `no_pressure`, `model_optimal`,
`queue_exhausted`, `target_budget`, `expansion_capacity`, `time_budget`, and `value_of_next_expansion`.
`model_optimal` is relative to the configured machine/cache-value model, semantic target graph, and canonical stage
contract—not a claim that observed TTFT is globally optimal. Aborted planning attempts are not published.

`request_done.timings_seconds` contains `prepare`, `ttft`, `vision`, `prefill`, `decode`, and `total`
as full-precision JSON numbers. Its `speculative` object contains `backend`, `draft_window`, `rounds`,
`drafted_tokens`, `accepted_tokens`, `fallback_steps`, and `accepted_per_position`. Rates can be
derived downstream from raw token counts and seconds instead of rounded stderr strings.

For `server_start.memory`, `workspace.capacity_bytes` is the only physical workspace allocation.
When Vision is enabled, `vision_workspace` reports the aggregate prompt and maximum-item token
bounds plus encode peak and handoff layout/usage within that same allocation; these bytes must not
be added to `workspace.capacity_bytes`. The field is `null` when Vision is disabled.

`request_done.engine_timing` separates FIFO `queue_wait_seconds`, blocking
`device_wait_exposed_seconds`, and five mutually exclusive Host-active exposure phases under
`host_exposed_seconds`: `engine_boundary`, `program_submit`, `program_post`,
`engine_commit_output`, and `engine_maintenance`. `total` is exactly their sum and excludes Device
wait. The nested `decode` object reports the request's decode-class Host exposure, Device wait, and
round count; `units` reports its prefill/control unit counts. In a compact batch every participating
request is delayed by the full round, so these values explain request latency but **must not be
summed across concurrent requests**.

The JSONL file contains no generated response text and never records an API-key value; `argv`
replaces that value with `<redacted>`. The existing stderr summaries remain available for operators
but are rounded and are not the aggregation source. Console lines use local
`[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm] [level]` timestamps. OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat, and Anthropic
generation requests receive a request ID when they enter synchronous preparation. Successful
preparation produces `request_start`; a preparation failure produces `request_rejected` without a
matching start. Later generation failures produce `request_error`. Schema/model validation
rejections before preparation and token-count-only calls are not measurement requests and do not
receive request IDs.

By default the server also reports aggregate activity every five seconds. `prefill` counts prompt
suffix tokens actually computed during the interval, excluding prefix-cache hits; `decode` counts
tokens finally committed by decode rounds, excluding the first token produced by prefill. For MTP
and DFlash this is the accepted committed output, not draft or rejected tokens.
`avg_decode_batch` is decode row-rounds divided by decode rounds during the same interval. The
`running`, `prefilling`, `decode_ready`, `waiting`, `materializing`, `capture_pending`, and
`terminal_pending` fields are the Engine scheduler snapshot at the end of the interval. The JSONL
`context_cache` object reports selection, capture, transfer, COW, pressure spill, private/shared
owner degradation and eviction, checkpoint drop, pressure search, budget exhaustion, maximal fallback, and historical-fork
counters as interval deltas; `occupancy` and `last_selection` are end-of-interval gauges. Materialization predictions are
request-owned and appear only on the corresponding `request_done` event.
`pressure.searches` counts plans accepted into Program resource transactions, including a transaction that later ends in
request-local abort; committed victim counters likewise report the resulting stable cache changes.

The JSONL `throughput.host_work` object is the aggregation authority: the Engine worker counts each
wall-time segment once, independent of batch size. `elapsed_seconds` contains the same five
mutually exclusive Host phases and their `total`; `device_wait_seconds` is separate.
`work_class_seconds` splits Host and Device-wait time into decode, prefill, and control classes.
`detail_subset_seconds` and `detail_invocations` expose admission, context-transaction, replica, and
stats-publication slow paths; these detail values are already contained in a top-level Host phase
and must not be added to `total`. Per-round, per-row-round, and per-invocation normalized values are
`null` when their denominator is zero. The stderr interval line shows only total Host milliseconds,
decode Host/device-wait microseconds per round, boundary, and maintenance; use JSONL for analysis.
Intervals with context materialization or retention activity are retained even when they contain no
token execution; only fully idle intervals are omitted. Downstream measurement should prefer the
raw counters and seconds over rounded stderr rates.

## Execution behavior

The server owns one resident Engine with a startup-fixed capacity of `1..8` active generation
requests. At each decode boundary, every decode-ready request is compacted into one batch and
processed by one model traversal and, when graphs are enabled, one exact-batch CUDA Graph replay. A
request joins that batch only after its single-request prefill finishes; when it completes or is
cancelled, the next boundary rebuilds the batch without an empty row.

`--max-pending-requests` bounds the requests waiting behind the active set. The total generation
request lifetime capacity is `max_concurrency + max_pending_requests`, including requests still in
CPU/media preparation and completed model results whose response has not yet been released. A full
capacity returns HTTP 429 with code `server_overloaded`. The absolute
`--pending-timeout-ms` deadline starts before preparation, covers media acquisition and Engine FIFO
waiting, and returns HTTP 503 with code `request_queue_timeout` if admission does not occur in time.
There is no admission ETA or unbounded overflow queue.

Input memory is bounded by the outstanding-request count and the per-request
`--max-request-mib` limit. Media requests additionally share one preparation permit, so a waiting
media request retains the same cancellation and timeout deadline. Model output is bounded by the
same finite request count and each request's effective output-token limit; output callbacks and
network serialization run outside the GPU executor and do not delay formation of the next batch.

`--max-context` is each sequence's logical ceiling. `--kv-capacity` fixes the shared Main Text KV
pool used by active requests and retained prefixes. `auto` accounts for the complete enabled runtime
and leaves 1 GiB of sizing headroom; omitting the option makes it follow `--max-context`. Capacity
resolves once at startup.

Admission reserves the full prompt-plus-effective-output page entitlement through request
completion. A request remains queued until a legal resource plan can satisfy that entitlement.

Each reusable checkpoint contains KV and complete continuation state. At admission, capture, and
finish boundaries, resource pressure may keep it on Device, move its StateImage and/or KV replicas
to pinned Host memory, or evict it. The planner compares incoming-request work with the later
recovery cost imposed on retained checkpoints. Active requests retain their state and completion
reservations, and placement choices preserve model semantics. The full policy and invariants are
defined in [Resource scheduling and context cache](maintainer/resource-scheduling-and-context-cache.md).

Compatible prefixes are reused for both text and multimodal histories unless the server starts with
`--no-prefix-reuse`. A multimodal hit additionally requires matching token types, three-axis MRoPE
positions, encoded-media digest, grid, and consumer spans. Media wholly inside a matched prefix
skips Vision execution, while new suffix media is encoded normally. The completion log reports the
reused token count as `cache=`.

The completion log reports one of six reuse paths: `root`, `private_endpoint`,
`private_turn_closure`, `private_response_replay`, `private_long_anchor`, or
`shared_stable_prefix`. Reuse validation covers KV, recurrent state, hidden state, selected-backend
state, and the exact prompt frontier. With stable `preserve_thinking=true`, the auxiliary checkpoint
rolls to the message frontier immediately before the current response's deterministic generation
prologue. A normalized response, compact-summary instruction, or replacement user suffix therefore
replays the small generation prologue and only the changed suffix while retaining the complete
stable conversation prefix. Stable `false` places the turn-closure checkpoint before the first
assistant opener in the open turn, so closing that turn can recompute its opener and omit its
reasoning without discarding the preceding conversation.

`preserve_thinking` selects the capture frontier for newly created checkpoints. Existing exact
checkpoints remain reusable across a mode change. If the desired boundary is behind the selected
reuse frontier and has no snapshot, the Engine keeps the valid hit and defers the new checkpoint. A
later request that diverges before every retained checkpoint starts from root. The JSONL completion
record exposes the restored checkpoint as `prefix_reuse_path`. Reasoning-effort changes participate
in rendered-token identity and exact-prefix selection.

An appended mid-conversation system message is an ordinary prompt suffix, so an unchanged prior
history remains eligible for `private_endpoint`. If the client modifies, removes, or moves a
historical system message, the token prefix genuinely differs and a miss/reset is correct.

Speculative backends preserve protocol output shapes, stop behavior, and usage accounting. If a stop
truncates a multi-token MTP or DFlash round, the Engine commits the exact accepted target prefix so
a following compatible turn can reuse it. Output-limit and context-capacity finishes map to
`length`/ `max_tokens`; ordinary model or string stops map to `stop`/ `end_turn`.

Function tools are rendered into the model prompt and generated calls are parsed into protocol
responses. NInfer does not execute tools and does not enforce client JSON Schema through constrained
decoding.

Prompt-token usage includes chat-template and expanded media tokens. Generated-token usage comes
from accepted output token IDs, including a stop token whose decoded text may be withheld.
