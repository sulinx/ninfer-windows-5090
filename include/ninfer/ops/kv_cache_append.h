 * Append every K/V row to single-sequence paged growing-cache storage.
 *
 * k/v are contiguous BF16 [256,4|2,T] and positions is contiguous sequential device I32 [T].
 * BF16 cache rows are copied bit-for-bit. INT8-G64 cache rows use one scale for each contiguous
 * 64-value group. For codec input values x, the persistent INT8 group encoding is
 *
 *   a          = max_i abs(FP32(x[i]))
 *   scale_bits = FP16_RNE(a / 127)
 *   s          = FP32(scale_bits)
 *   inv        = s == 0 ? 0 : FP32(1 / s)
 *   code[i]    = s == 0 ? 0 : I8(clamp(RNE_even(FP32(x[i]) * inv), -127, 127))
 *   decode[i]  = FP32(code[i]) * s.
 *
 * FP8_E4M3FN cache rows use one FP16 scale for the complete D256 row:
 *
 *   a          = max_i abs(FP32(x[i]))
 *   a == 0: scale_bits=FP16(+0), code[i]=E4M3FN(+0)
 *   a != 0: raw_scale  = a / 448
 *           scale_bits = FP16_RNE(clamp(raw_scale, 0x1p-24, 65504))
 *           s          = FP32(scale_bits)
 *           inv        = FP32(1 / s)
 *           code[i]    = E4M3FN_RNE_SATFINITE(FP32(x[i]) * inv)
 *   decode[i] = FP32(E4M3FN(code[i])) * s.
 *
 * V uses represented BF16 source values directly as x. For both quantized profiles, K is a paired
 * physical representation for causal Attention: its implementation-owned fixed orthogonal
 * preparation selects x, and the causal consumer applies the matching private Q preparation. The
 * transform and raw K code/scale bytes are not standalone mathematical outputs. Standalone and
 * fused append produce the same consumable K representation. Every addressed code/value and scale
 * is overwritten, and no unrelated cache row is read or written. Inputs and every cache
 * plane/table are pairwise non-overlapping. The Op owns no persistent allocation, frontier,
 * request identity, or commit authority.
